# CompuDECSI - Project Vision

**Computer Science Week Application**

## 1. Introduction

This document describes the overall vision for the Computer Science Week Application project. The goal is to develop a centralized mobile solution to optimize the experience of participants and the management of DECSI's annual computer science event.

The initial project will focus on delivering the most critical functionalities for the event's success within a limited timeframe. However, the long-term vision is to transform the application into an indispensable tool that automates complex processes, such as certificate issuance, integrating with university systems.

The application will initially be developed for the Android platform using Flutter technology.

## 2. Problem

Currently, the organization of Computer Science Week faces challenges that impact the experience of students, speakers, and organizers:

### Information Disorganization
Event programming, activity locations, and important announcements are communicated through various channels, making centralized and real-time access difficult.

### Low Engagement
Interaction between participants and speakers is limited, such as sending questions during lectures, which is often done in an improvised manner.

### Manual Participation Management
The check-in process for each activity is manual, creating queues and making it difficult to collect attendance data for organizers.

### Future Certification Process
The issuance and delivery of participation certificates is a manual and laborious process that occurs after the event. The lack of automation consumes time and is prone to errors.

## 3. Target Audience and Stakeholders

The application is intended for everyone involved in Computer Science Week, with a primary focus on the following groups:

### Students (Primary Audience)
Event participants who seek an easy way to access the schedule, organize their agendas, and interact with activities.

### Event Organizers
Team responsible for planning and executing the event, who need tools to manage participation and communicate with attendees.

### Speakers
Presenters who will benefit from a direct channel to receive questions from the audience.

### Professors and Coordinators (DECSI)
Interested in the overall success of the event and the modernization of their management tools.

## 4. Product Vision

For Computer Science Week participants who want a more organized and interactive experience, the **Computer Science Week Application** is a mobile event assistant that centralizes all important information, from the complete schedule to a personalized agenda.

Unlike traditional methods such as flyers and message groups, our product offers:
- Check-in through a code automatically generated when creating an event
- Real-time question and answer system
- Control panel for organizers

Our long-term vision is to automate the event participation cycle, culminating in the automatic issuance of certificates through secure integration with the university database, eliminating the need for post-event manual processes.

## 5. Scope and Functionalities

Development will be divided into an initial version (MVP) with essential functionalities, followed by future versions that will expand the application's capabilities.

### 5.1. Initial Scope (MVP)

The focus is to deliver a functional application for the next Computer Science Week. The main deliverables include:

#### Functional Android Application
- **Event Programming Module**: Complete schedule consultation with filters by activity type
- **Personalized Agenda**: Allows users to mark activities of their interest and receive reminders
- **Check-in System**: Quick check-in for activities using unique code for attendance registration
- **Real-time Q&A**: Sending and voting on questions for speakers during presentations
- **Organizer Panel**: Dashboard with participation statistics and activity monitoring
- **General Information**: Area with speaker profiles

#### Explicitly outside initial scope:
- iOS version
- Chat system between participants
- Online registrations or payments
- Complete digital certification system

### 5.2. Future Scope Vision

After MVP validation, the project will evolve to include:

- **University Database Integration**: To validate student information and automate processes
- **Automated Certificate Issuance**: Generation and delivery of digital certificates based on user check-in history
- **iOS Version**: Platform expansion to serve iPhone users
- **Social Media Integration**: For sharing and greater engagement

## 6. Constraints and Assumptions

### 6.1. Constraints

- **Deadline**: The application must be completed and published one week before the end of the academic semester
- **Budget**: The project operates with a simulated and limited budget, without major external costs
- **Human Resources**: The team is small, composed of 5 members

### 6.2. Assumptions

- The event schedule will be provided in advance and will not undergo major changes
- There will be stable and available Wi-Fi connection at event locations
- The team has basic knowledge of Flutter for development
- There will be availability of speakers and organizers for testing and feedback
